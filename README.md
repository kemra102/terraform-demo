# Terraform Demo

My Terraform Playground.

This is where I play around with ideas in Terraform, explore new functionality and provide myself reminders about this functionality for future use.

## Git Hooks

```sh
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) && ln -s scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
